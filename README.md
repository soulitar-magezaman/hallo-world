initiatiating a new frontier
in these first steps I am learning how does the github flow works.
these lines on first chapter are the result of the first branching of the main file
## first chapter
1. get to know the flow
2. create a branch
3. make edits to that branch
4. pull request
5. check and approve
6. commit? - this is wrong. explained in chapter two
7. ea

let's see

end of first chapter

## second chapter
the definition of commit is not what you get from chapter 1.

commit is when you make a change and make it public.
so by writing this and finishing, that is a commit.

a commit is also applying a suggested review

therefore, the previous chapter should be corrected to:
1. get to know the flow
2. create a branch
3. make edits to that branch, then upload those commits
4. pull request
5. check and review
6. apply suggested changes, new commits
7. approve
8. ea

end of second chapter
